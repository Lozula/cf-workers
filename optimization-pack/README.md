# Web Performance Optimization Pack

Combined set of workers to optimize performance. Currently a combined set of:

* WebP rewrite - Returns WebP versions of images if browser supports webp, and if a suitable webp image exists. Adapted from [this worker](https://github.com/vidaxl-com/cloudflare_webworkers/blob/master/examples/webp.js)
* [Fast Google Fonts](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-examples/tree/master/examples/fast-google-fonts) - Inlines the browser-specific font CSS and re-hosts the font files through the page origin (saving round trips). Blog post with more details [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/).
* [Third-party Scripts](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-examples/tree/master/examples/third-party-scripts) - Cache-extends and rehosts static third-party scripts from well-known providers (things like Ajax library CDN's, static analytics code, A/B testing code, etc).
* [Edge-Cache HTML](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-examples/tree/master/examples/edge-cache-html) - Caches dynamic HTML on the edge when combined with a CMS that supports it (plugin for wordpress is available). Blog post with more details [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/improving-html-time-to-first-byte/)

This operates on blocking responses and processes the full HTML with no streaming which can cause pages that rely on early flushing to perform slower (rare but worth being aware of).

Caution, this has not been tested extensively in a production environment so there may still be some edge cases that are not handled.

Individual optimizations can be turned on or off by changing the boolean variables for each one at the top of the script.
